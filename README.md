Hello, I'm Chi Yunng (pronounced *chee-young*) and welcome to my site! Currently, I am studying the MSc in Data Science at LSE and have 2 years prior experience as a training actuary in the insurance industry. I created this site to showcase projects from my academic and professional journey. You'll find that they span both R and Python, with Python being my most recently learnt. Feel free to explore and I hope you find them insightful. :smiley:

You can learn more about me and my projects below!
