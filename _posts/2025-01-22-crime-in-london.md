## Introduction

The relationship between crime and socioeconomic factors has been a subject of interest for a long time, with researchers looking to understand the underlying determinants that drive criminal behavior. Beckerâ€™s (1968) Rational Model of Crime suggests that individuals engage in criminal activity when the expected economic benefits outweigh the risks or costs. Present-oriented theories such as the Myopic Theory of Crime (Buonanno, 2003) emphasize the impact of broader social determinants, such as inequality, education, urbanization, and community structures.

These factors have been found to be linked to crime, but these connections are often complex and vary across types of crime and geography (Zhou, Wang and Zhou, 2023). This project aims to understand these links in the context of London. Using local government and UK police data, this project will investigate, various socioeconomic factors of choice and their relationship with crime. 

Another angle in this analysis will focus on time-series analysis. Exploring temporal dynamics important implications for developing policy responses, particularly as predictive policing gains popularity among police forces globally (Meijer and Wessels, 2019). Predictive policing involves using data to forecast crime activity, identify dangerous crime hotspots or individuals at risk of offending, enabling law enforcement to allocate resources more efficiently and crucially, before a crime occurs. 

This project will attempt to uncover potential relationships between determinants and crime levels as well as look at temporal analysis to build a simple prediction models of crime.
